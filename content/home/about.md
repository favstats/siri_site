I received a Bachelor degree in Business Administration from an international program at Shangxi University in China that was completed at the FOM Essen in Germany. I am very passionate about Chinese Football and everything sports related. I am very interested in innovative projects that connect Chinese and German businesses in a win-win situation.

Currently looking for work in the German-Chinese job market.
