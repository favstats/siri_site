I noticed *four difficulties* in the sector of Chinese-German Football:

1. **Lack of connectivity** between DFB and CFA (Chinese Football Association)
2. **Different understandings** for one's own interests and efficiency of Germans and Chinese
3. Good business ideas, but **no proper localization** in the Chinese market
4. Stalemate in cooperation due to striving for **fast remuneration** on the basis of both sides (Chinese: good performance & Germans: financial income)

With regard to the difficulties mentioned above, some **practical suggestions** are made from of my perspectives for German decision-makers in the field of football:

+ Concentration on joint projects for young footballers 

> Focus: International Football matches for young/amateur footballers born 2009-2010

+ Cheap price offers for the Chinese football fan market 

> Reasons: There are many football fans in China. But compared to Chinese basketball fans, the football fans are not very rich and somewhat more frugal and reserved. That's why you can also use suitable and low priced offers to reach these customers.

+ Discover a superstar in Chinese football together with Chinese government

> In my opinion there is still a superstar missing in Chinese football like Ming Yao, the most famous Chinese basketball player in the NBA. Besides the talent and the competence in football, this Chinese superstar has to come out of a family with football culture and relative prosperity, for example his parents should be engaged in football related work. Besides he must have strong patriotism,  be open-minded & highly educated.  The search for such a potential superstar should not just be organized by private entities but can also be powered by the Chinese government, which has a great interest in finding a good representation of China to the world.  If this player can play in a German soccer club, the Chinese will consider the football club as their home team. Ideally, this German soccer club should be an average club in the first Bundesliga, because then the Chinese player can help improve the club as well. Then the German Football club will receive great interest, reputation and sales from China.

+ Searching for German-Chinese Young/Amateur Footballers
+ The international (German) soccer schools in China should band together with the Chinese education system.

> The international (German) trainers should implement a training schedule that allows Chinese trainees to compete on the international football market
