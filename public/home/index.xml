      <description>Biography Resume (in German)
I am a graduate of the Economics Master program at the University of Augsburg in Germany and the focus of my studies is Strategy and Information. I received a Bachelor degree in Business Administration from an international program at Shangxi University in China that was completed at the FOM Essen in Germany. I am very passionate about Chinese Football and everything sports related. I am very interested in innovative projects that connect Chinese and German businesses in a win-win situation.</description>
